Help you avoid missing daily commits. I hope it helps with consistent motivation rather than cheating!

(Come to think of it, even after Iâ€™m gone, this friend will keep planting grass... Hmm... this feels a bit dystopian, doesnâ€™t it? ðŸ¤–)

## How to get started

1. **Generate <u>Access token</u>**
   - Go to [settings] - [Developer settings] - [Personal access tokens]
   - Click to [Generate new token]
   - Select [repo] from the [scope] selection
2. **Setting <u>Actions secrets</u>**
   - Go to [Settings] - [Secret and variables] - [Actions]
   - Add New repository secrets for _ACCESS_TOKEN_, _USER_NAME_ and _USER_EMAIL_
3. **Check your Workflows schedule in <u>bot.yml</u>**
   - This is based on UTC, so modify as needed.
